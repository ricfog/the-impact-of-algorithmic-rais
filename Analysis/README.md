The files in this folder contain (most of) the code used for the analysis in the
paper. These files are

* `Analysis_impact_of_RAI.R`: analysis of the impact of the RAI on participants'
  predictions. More specifically, analysis of updates in non-anchoring,
  anchoring vs non-anchoring, decreasing vs controlled.
* `Analysis_of_performance.R`: analysis of real and self-reported predictive
  performance.
* `Analysis_of_time.R`: analysis of time spent by participants on the entire survey, to complete the HIT on MTurk, and on
  each of the assessments; analysis of time in relation to accuracy.
* `Comparison_prediction_decision.R`: analysis of how judicial decisions (of
  whether to incarcerate) compare to the participants' and the RAI's predictions
  of re-arrest.
* `Analysis_racial_disparities.R`: analysis of fthe airness properties of the
  predictions made by participants.
* `Analysis_probability_and_binary_predictions.R`: analysis of (the mapping
  from) probability and binary predictions.
* `General_summary_statistics.R`: summary statistics for participants (e.g.,
  demographics and time spent on survey) and their predictions.

Note that the data that we made available will allow you to run most but not all
of the analysis presented in the paper. The full analysis requires access to
more detailed data on the offenders. For more information on the features included in
the data, see the `README.md` file in the `Data` folder.
